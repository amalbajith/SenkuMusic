## ❓ **Troubleshooting**

### **"Can't see my files"**
**Solution**: 
- Make sure files are **.mp3** format
- Check file location is accessible
- Try moving files to "On My iPhone" folder

### **"Files not importing"**
**Solution**:
- Verify files are actually MP3 format (not renamed)
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Try importing one file at a time to identify problem file

### **"No metadata showing"**
**Solution**:
- MP3 file doesn't have ID3 tags
- Use Mp3tag (free) to add metadata
- Re-import after adding tags

### **"Duplicate songs appearing"**
**Solution**:
- App checks file URL, not content
- If you moved/copied the file, it has a new URL
- Delete duplicates from Settings → Clear Library, then re-import
